# Tribbute Page from FCC
Tribute Page Project From Free Coding Camp.
This is a static website made just from HTML and CSS. It is supposed to pass all of test case provided by FreeCodingCamp. 

This website is a tribute to internet. It is strictly based off of **sample website provided by FreeCodingCamp**. (https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).

In process of making this website, I used timeline internet history timeline from Jefferson University,
which can be accessed here: https://online.jefferson.edu/communications/internet-history-timeline/

For purpose of earning certificate, I may post the exact same content over CodePen.
